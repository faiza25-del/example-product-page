                            <p>In the ‘70s, Nike was the new shoe on the block. <br>
                                So new in fact, we were still breaking into the <br>
                                basketball scene and testing prototypes on the feet <br>
                                of our local team. Of course, the design improved <br>
                                over the years, but the name stuck. The Nike Blazer <br>
                                Mid ’77 Vintage—classic since the beginning.</p>

                            <p>We remixed a classic with at least 20% recycled <br>
                                material by weight, making the Air Force 1 Crater a <br>
                                sneaker for the modern era. The translucent toe <br>
                                reveals a vibrant blend of materials beneath for a <br>
                                bold, 1-of-a-kind look. Nike Grind rubber on the <br>
